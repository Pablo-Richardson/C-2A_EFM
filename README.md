This is the External Flight Model for my C-2A Mod for DCS. In it's current form it is not complete, or too detailed, as I would just like to get something working at first. Once it is working, I will use this as reference to finish writing my DCS Modding Guide (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n3RZkRSckOGxgCAFjWAAoPCTamej6hsfszYObVCgt_4/edit?usp=sharing). Once I complete the modding guide, I will add more detail to this flight model.
